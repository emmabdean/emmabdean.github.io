I am an Assistant Professor at [ The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice](https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/tdi/) and a member of [The Dartmouth Cancer Center](https://cancer.dartmouth.edu/) and the [Susan J. and Richard M. Levy 1960 Academic Cluster in Health Care Delivery](https://provost.dartmouth.edu/initiatives/academic-clusters)  at Dartmouth College. I'm a health economist whose research focuses on the pharmaceutical industry and the relationship between poverty and health. I hold a Ph.D. in Managerial Sciences and Applied Economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Prior to academia, I worked as a management consultant with a focus on the pharmaceutical industry.
