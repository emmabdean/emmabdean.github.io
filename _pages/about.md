I am an Assistant Professor at [ The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice](https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/tdi/). I'm a health economist whose research focuses on the pharmaceutical industry and the relationship between poverty and health. I hold a Ph.D. in Managerial Sciences and Applied Economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Prior to academia, I worked as a management consultant with a focus on the pharmaceutical industry.
