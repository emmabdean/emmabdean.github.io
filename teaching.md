<b>HSM 310 and HSM 620: Population Health</b> Population health is emerging as a field of study of health determinants, a concept of health, and a goal of achieving measurable improvements in the health of a defined population. These populations can encompass geographic regions, such as communities, states, or nations, but can also be groups, including groups based on need, employment, ethnicity, members of Accountable Care Organizations, and other populations with relevance to policymakers. In this course, students will gain an understanding of the determinants of population health, population health outcomes, and policies and interventions that link the determinants and outcomes.
